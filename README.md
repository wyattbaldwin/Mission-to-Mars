# Mission to Mars

In this project, we utilized automated browsing with Splinter and web scraping with Beautiful Soup to gather data from the Mars news site. The titles and preview text of the articles were scraped and stored in a list of dictionaries.

We also used either Pandas or a combination of Splinter and Beautiful Soup to scrape data about Mars' weather from a HTML table. This data was then placed in a Pandas DataFrame and analyzed to answer several questions. We determined that there are 12 months on Mars and 687 Martian days' worth of data. We also found that the coldest month on average is the 7th month and the warmest is the 1st month, while the month with the lowest average atmospheric pressure is the 6th month and the highest is the 9th month. We also made an estimate, within 25%, of how many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year. Finally, we exported the DataFrame into a CSV file.

Overall, this project allowed us to gather and analyze information about the climate on Mars using web scraping techniques.
